Hi,

I am a computational physicist by training currently working as researcher on biostatistics, data science and machine learning. My main projects are in the development of prediction models for head and neck cancer. I have experience in several programming languages such as Python, R, Fortran90-20xx, C++, and many data science tools.

You may notice that my previous field was on developing and implementing mathematical models for biological systems, where I used modern Fortran for high performance computing.
